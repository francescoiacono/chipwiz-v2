# What is ChipWiz?

ChipWiz is a web application, designed to streamline the process of keeping track of poker chips during your games, so that you can easily concentrate on your poker skills and eliminating the need for physical chips.

### Motivation

ChipWiz is one of my personal projects for my [portofolio](https://www.francescoiacono.co.uk/). The primary goal behind this project was to create a tool to play poker with friends in the absence of physical poker chips and to test and improve my web development knowledge with Next.js and Firebase.
